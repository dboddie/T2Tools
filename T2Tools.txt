Introduction

This package is a collection of Python scripts which convert between
various formats of archive files related to the BBC and Acorn Electron
microcomputers. In order to run them, you need to obtain a Python
interpreter for your computer platform. Look at

for information regarding installation and usage of Python.


The Tools

There are seven scripts available:

ADF2INF.py	Extracts files from ADFS disc images and stores
		them in directories on the native filesystem with
		suitable .inf files. Disc images are usually files
		with the suffix .adf or similar.
		Should be able to deal with 160K, 320K (F format),
		640K (L format), 800K (D and E format) and 1600K
		(E format) disc images.

File2UEF.py	Takes a set of files stored on a RISC OS machine,
		with load, execution and length information intact,
		and stores them in a UEF file.

INF2File.py	Converts files in INF format to standard files with
		load, execution and length information on a RISC OS
		machine.

INF2UEF.py	Takes a directory of files stored on the native
		file system with accompanying .inf files and stores
		them in a UEF file.

T2Peg400.py 	Converts Slogger T2 files, created by ROMs such as
		T2P3, T2P4, T2Peg400 or similar, to a directory of
		files on the native filesystem with accompanying
		.inf files which describe the files' attributes for
		emulators.

T2UEF.py	Converts Slogger T2 files to UEF files for use with
		ElectrEm (http://electrem.emuunlim.com/).

UEF2INF.py	Converts a UEF file to a directory containing files
		with their associated .inf files.
