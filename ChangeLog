0.10 (Wed 11th July 2001)
First release.

0.11 (Thu 12th July 2001)
Added various chunks to those recognised by the "chunks" command.
Insert, extract and remove commands now support operations on
individual chunks as well as on files.

0.20 (Fri 13th July 2001)
Finalised changes to the insert and extract commands.
Changed the filename format for importing and exporting chunks of
arbitrary chunk number to requiring a hexadecimal suffix.

Added the chunk information for changes of baud rate (0x113).

0.22 (Tue 17th July 2001)
Changed my e-mail address and WWW address (above).
Added some comments and help messages.
Corrected the chunk number for memory to the correct value (0x410). 

0.23 (Sat 21st July 2001)
Added the detailed information command (wwwinfo).

0.24 (Mon 23rd July 2001)
Made the integer division in the number function explicit.

0.30 (Tue 24th July 2001)
Added functionality so that files and chunks can be extracted to
other UEF files.

0.31 (Tue 24th July 2001)
The creator chunk is now automatically written when extracting
files to a new UEF file.

0.32 (Wed 25th July 2001)
Checks the namespace so that the script can be imported as a module.

0.33 (Thu 26th July 2001)
Allowed for chunks to have data of zero bytes in length.
Modified the function to read the creator and emulator information
to take this possibility into account.

0.40 (Fri 10th August 2001)
Corrected the conversion of tape data chunks which included start and
stop bits (chunk 0x102) when extracting files.

0.41 (Mon 13th August 2001)
Added UEF file version information reporting to info and wwwinfo
commands.
Fixed the new command so that the keyboard layout is set correctly.

0.411c (Sat 27th April 2002)
Minor correction to the spelling of the target_machine variable
when it is initialised.

This version requires the cmdsyntax module in order to operate,
but can optionally generate a GUI if invalid syntax is used to
invoke the program.

0.412c (Fri 3rd May 2002)
The first match is obtained earlier to ensure that, when the GUI
returns no information, the general help message is displayed.

0.42c (Tue 15th April 2003)
Changed the call to the cmdsyntax.Form.get_args method as the new
cmdsyntax (0.80) behaviour has been changed to be more consistent
with the Syntax.get_args behaviour.
The form can now also use valid information from failed matches to
provide default values for form fields.
